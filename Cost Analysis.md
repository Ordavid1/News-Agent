> what are the free tiers of NewsAPI and GNEWS? i think i onced 
  capped the app adjusted to them

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user is asking about the free tiers of NewsAPI and GNews. Let 
  me look for any information about rate limits or free tier usage 
  in the code to understand how the app might be adjusted to work 
  within free tier limits.

‚è∫ Let me check the app's configuration for API rate limits and free
  tier usage:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "rate limit|pageSize|max:|limit:", output_mode:
        "content", head_limit: 20)
  ‚éø  Found 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now let me look specifically for NewsAPI and GNews configuration 
  in the code to see the pageSize and other parameters that might 
  indicate free tier usage.

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "pageSize:|max:|NewsAPI|GNews|gnews", path:
        "index.mjs", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 33 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  I can see the app is configured to fetch 20 articles per request 
  (pageSize: 20 for NewsAPI and max: 20 for GNews). Let me also 
  check if there's any Google CSE usage tracking or rate limiting in
   the code.

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "CSE|checkAndResetCseUsage|cseUsage", output_mode:
         "content", head_limit: 30)
  ‚éø  Found 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Great! I found the rate limiting information. Let me also check if
   there are any mentions of free tier limits or adjustments in the 
  codebase.

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "free tier|developer plan|500 requests|1000
        requests|100 requests|daily limit", output_mode: "content",
        head_limit: 20)
  ‚éø  Found 6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the free tier limits.
   Let me compile this information for the user.

  usage:
